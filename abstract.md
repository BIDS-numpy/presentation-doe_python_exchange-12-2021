# Python: the language for effective scientific computing

In this presentation, I address the question "Why Python?" for scientific
computing through the lens of my own personal experience as a researcher in
the national lab system and contributor to open-source scientific Python
software.
Python's generality, support for extensions, and ability to integrate with
other languages make it applicable across the full spectrum of scientific
computing tasks: from hardware integration, workstation-scale data analysis, to
cluster-scale computational workflows.
The scientific Python ecosystem has become the de facto standard for scientific
and data-driven computational tasks, providing access to performant tools with
applications across all domains.
The scientific Python ecosystem allows researchers to perform analyses in a
simple, expressive syntax that forms the basis of effective scientific
communication and reproducibile of results.
In addition to the technical aspects that make Python a great fit for scientific
research, the community-driven development model has played a central role in
the success of the scientific Python ecosystem.
As scientific Python continues to grow and support an ever-expanding base of users,
we look ahead to the future of the ecosystem and explore ways to ensure that it can
continue to grow sustainably, get the necessary tools into the hands of
researchers, and remain on the cutting edge of scientific research.
