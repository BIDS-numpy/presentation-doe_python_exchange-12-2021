# DOE Python Exchange Talk, December 1st 2021

Presentation for the DOE Python Exchange event on December 1st, 2021.
The presentation is entitled **Python: the language for effective scientific computing**
and addresses the question: "Why Python" in the context of scientific computing.

For more info, please check out the abstract.

# How to follow along

Please feel free to follow along with the presentation, or refer to it after
the session is over.
There are two main ways to follow along: either interactively or with a
version rendered as a static website.

## Interactively

The presentation uses the [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package
to convert the notebook into an interactive presentation.
To run the presentation locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/presentation-doe_python_exchange-12-2021.git`

2. Install the dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Launch the notebook: `jupyter notebook`

Once inside the notebook, you can toggle in and out of presentation mode with
the `alt+r` shortcut.
Use `space` to navigate forward and `shift+space` to navigage backwards.
You can execute code cells with the standard `shift+enter` command.
For a full listing of the RISE keyboard shortcuts, see
[the RISE documentation](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html).

## Static site

The presentation is also available online:

https://bids-numpy.github.io/presentation-doe_python_exchange-12-2021/

This includes the full presentation, with all the code cells pre-executed.
Note however that the notebook was designed to be given interactively, so the
website might not flow as nicely.
